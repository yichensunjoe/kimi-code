/**
 * `workspaceRegistry` domain (L2) — `IWorkspacePersistence` contract.
 *
 * Domain-specific persistence Store for the known-workspaces catalog. It hides
 * the on-disk document layout (`<homeDir>/workspaces.json`, the v1-compatible
 * `{ version, workspaces: { [id]: entry }, deleted_workspace_ids: string[] }`
 * shape — shared with agent-core, which reads and writes the same file) and
 * its serialization concerns (ISO ↔ epoch-ms, record ↔ array) from the
 * registry. The generic `IAtomicDocumentStore` it builds on stays
 * schema-agnostic.
 *
 * `deleted_workspace_ids` is the soft-delete tombstone list: ids the user
 * explicitly removed. Tombstoned entries are absent from `workspaces`, but
 * their ids must survive load/save round-trips so the session-index merge
 * never resurrects them.
 *
 * `load()` returns `undefined` to mean "no usable catalog" so the registry can
 * trigger a one-shot rebuild from the legacy session index; an empty catalog
 * is a valid, already-materialized state and must NOT trigger a rebuild.
 *
 * `WorkspaceCatalog.raw` carries the opaque document the catalog was loaded
 * from; `save` re-applies the semantic view onto it so unknown top-level and
 * entry fields written by other engine versions survive the round-trip under
 * the shared file's read-modify-write contract.
