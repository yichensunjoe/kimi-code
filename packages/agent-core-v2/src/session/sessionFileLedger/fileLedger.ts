/**
 * `sessionFileLedger` domain (L2) — per-session optimistic-concurrency ledger.
 *
 * Defines the `ISessionFileLedger` that remembers, per normalized absolute
 * path, the on-disk stat tuple (`ino`, `mtimeMs`, `size`, existence) this
 * session last successfully read or wrote. Before every Write/Edit, `compare`
 * stats the target again and compares the tuple directly. The mechanism is
 * detection, not mutual exclusion: it blocks stale writes it can observe and
 * deliberately accepts the residual stat→write race, which no
 * cooperating-process lock could close against external editors anyway.
 *
 * The verdict drives the write-path policy: `clean` lets the call through,
 * `stale` means the file diverged since the baseline, and `no-baseline` means
 * the target exists on disk but this session never read or wrote it (the
 * read-first case). New-file creation is always `clean`.
 *
 * The ledger is in-memory only: never persisted, never journaled, never part
 * of diagnostics. `resume` and `fork` therefore start from an empty ledger
 * and conservatively require a fresh read before editing existing files.
 * Baselines refresh only on successful Read/Write/Edit executions, and only
 * full reads of the target file count. Keys are lexical
 * `normalizeFsWatchKey`s — no `realpath`, so symlink aliases to the same
 * inode are an accepted residual gap. Session-scoped.
