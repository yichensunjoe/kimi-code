/**
 * `sessionLease` domain (L1) — the per-session write lease.
 *
 * Defines `ISessionLeaseService`, the Session-scope seeded ownership view,
 * and the `SessionLease` object that satisfies it together with the
 * `ISessionWriteGate` used by storage: an App-owned wrapper
 * (`SessionLifecycleService` builds it; it is deliberately not a DI service)
 * around the cross-process lock handle at
 * `<homeDir>/session-leases/<sessionId>.lock`. `assertWritable` is the hard
 * gate: it checks the live kernel-lock handle — a released or replaced
 * sentinel fails closed with
 * `session.lease_lost`, marks the lease lost, seals write admission, and fires
 * the loss callback exactly once so the owning session tears itself down.
 * The gate tracks admitted writes so lifecycle release can await their drain.
 *
 * No default is registered for either Session-scoped view: every production
 * session scope is seeded by `sessionLifecycle` via {@link sessionLeaseSeed};
 * resolving one unseeded (a session that bypassed materialization) is a bug
 * and must fail loudly rather than silently disable the fencing gate.
