/**
 * `sessionLease` domain (L1) — the per-session write lease.
 *
 * Defines `ISessionLeaseService`, the Session-scope seeded capability that
 * state writers use to verify they still own the session's durable state,
 * and the `SessionLease` object that satisfies it: an App-owned wrapper
 * (`SessionLifecycleService` builds it; it is deliberately not a DI service)
 * around the cross-process lock handle at
 * `<homeDir>/session-leases/<sessionId>.lock`. `assertWritable` is the hard
 * gate: it checks the live kernel-lock handle — a released or replaced
 * sentinel fails closed with
 * `session.lease_lost`, marks the lease lost, and fires the loss callback
 * exactly once so the owning session tears itself down. Release order is the
 * lifecycle's business; `release()` only forwards to the idempotent kernel
 * lock release.
 *
 * No default is registered for `ISessionLeaseService`: every production
 * session scope is seeded by `sessionLifecycle` via {@link sessionLeaseSeed};
 * resolving it unseeded (a session that bypassed materialization) is a bug
 * and must fail loudly rather than silently disable the fencing gate.
