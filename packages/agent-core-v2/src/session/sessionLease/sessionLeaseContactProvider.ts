/**
 * `sessionLease` domain (L1) — host-provided lease contact address.
 *
 * Holds what a session lease payload should advertise for this instance:
 * `{type: 'address', address}` when the host runs a routable network service
 * (kap-server seeds its listening address), `{type: 'local'}` otherwise —
 * the value is recorded in the lease payload so a blocked peer can tell a
 * routable holder from a local-only one (the discriminated `contact` union
 * lands as the flat `address?` payload field). Read
 * lazily at every lease acquisition through the `contact` thunk, so a host
 * whose address is only known after listen can seed a provider that closes
 * over it. Composition roots override the local-only default through
 * {@link sessionLeaseContactSeed}; embedded engines pass nothing and keep
 * the default. Bound at App scope.
